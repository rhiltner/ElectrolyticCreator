#ElectrolyticCreator
A little crawler and creation iterator script I threw together to pull videos from different channels and create a playlist on my own channel.

Todo:
- Filter by time > 2:00 < 10:00
- Randomize final output of crawler
- Wipe videolist between each run
- Keep track of playlist name and update accordingly
- Combine crawler and interator into single process
- Figure out how to track and remove duplicate songs
